# Bonus Tasks:

## Added color of changed tickers:

- if the color is green, then the price has increased;
- if the color is red, then the price has decreased or remained the same;
- When I get new tickers, I save old tickers and compare their prices

## Added button to activate or disable the ticker:

- if the color is grey, then the ticker is disabled
- I added new parameter on the server and change it with request to the server. And when new data comes this ticker will
  be disabled of activated

## Added delete button and input add tickers:

- If you click on button "DELETE", new data will be without this ticker
- If you want to add new ticker, you should write name of ticker and press button (the new ticker must not be repeated
  or without a name otherwise you will get an error)

## You can change update time

- You can write time in Input (in ms) and press button time. The connection will be disconnected and reconnected
